Project Title: Exploring BRCA1 and BRCA2 Genes in Breast Cancer

This project delves into the genetic landscape of breast cancer, 
particularly focusing on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are known 
to play crucial roles in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes. 
Leveraging data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 
(mentioned in project docx file), the project involves data manipulation 
techniques to extract relevant information related to these genes from the 
breast cancer dataset. 
Through comprehensive visualizations, including charts and graphs, the 
project aims to provide insights into the prevalence and significance of 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in breast cancer cases. By exploring this genetic 
aspect, the project contributes to a better understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms underlying breast cancer development
